        description: "A comprehensive solar retrofit for a large logistics facility in Melbourne's industrial south-east. Facing rising energy costs and a corporate mandate to reduce carbon footprint, this business needed a high-yield system capable of offsetting significant daytime consumption.",
        challenge: "The facility operates 24/7 with heavy HVAC and lighting loads. The roof structure had multiple skylights and ventilation units, causing partial uniform shading that would cripple a traditional string inverter system.",
        solution: "We deployed a 39.6kW system utilising Enphase IQ8 micro-inverters. This architecture ensures that shaded panels do not drag down the performance of the rest of the array. The system was integrated with the facility's existing 3-phase supply, with zero-export limiting to comply with local grid constraints.",

        description: "As part of the Victorian government's push towards electrification, this heritage home in Brighton transitioned from an inefficient gas storage unit to a modern, whisper-quiet Reclaim Energy CO2 Heat Pump.",
        challenge: "The homeowners were facing skyrocketing gas bills during Melbourne's chilly winters. They needed a solution that would be reliable in low temperatures (down to -5°C) without the noise of a standard compressor, located near bedroom windows.",
        solution: "Pure Planet installed a top-tier CO2 heat pump system. Unlike traditional refrigerants, CO2 offers superior performance in cold climates, maintaining high COP (Coefficient of Performance) even on frosty Melbourne mornings. We utilized the Solar Victory Hot Water Rebate to significantly reduce the upfront cost.",

        challenge: "The property had strict estate covenants regarding street appeal and panel visibility. The family also planned to add an EV charger in the future, requiring a 'battery-ready' design.",
        solution: "We selected all-black 440W panels for a sleek, unobtrusive look that satisfied estate guidelines. The system is paired with a 5kW hybrid-ready inverter, allowing the customer to 'plug and play' a battery or EV charger down the track without expensive switchboard upgrades.",

        solution: "We installed a Tesla Powerwall 2 with Gateway 2 backup. The system is configured for 'Time-Based Control', charging from the grid during off-peak windows if solar generation is low, and discharging during peak tariff times to maximize financial savings along with security.",
