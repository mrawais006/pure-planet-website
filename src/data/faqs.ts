        question: "Am I eligible for the $1,400 Solar Victoria rebate?",
        answer: "Most likely! To qualify, you must be a Victorian homeowner with a combined household income of less than $210,000 per year, and your property value must be under $3 million. We handle the entire application process for you to ensure instant approval."

        question: "Do electric heat pumps really work in freezing Melbourne weather?",
        answer: "Absolutely. Modern CO2 heat pumps (like the Reclaim Energy units we install) are designed to operate efficiently in temperatures down to -10°C. They are actually more efficient than gas heating because they 'move' heat rather than creating it."
    },
    {
        question: "How much will a 6.6kW solar system actually save me?",
        answer: "On average, a 6.6kW system in Melbourne saves households between $1,200 and $1,800 per year, depending on your usage patterns. If you add a battery, you can increase these savings by storing your daytime power for evening use."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you offer $0 upfront payment plans?",
        answer: "Yes. We offer Solar Victoria's interest-free loan (up to $1,400) which is paid back over 4 years. We also have partnerships with green finance providers to cover the 'gap' payment, meaning you can often start saving immediately with $0 out of pocket."
    },
    {
        question: "How long does installation take?",
        answer: "A standard residential solar installation takes 1 day. A solar + battery + heat pump full home upgrade typically takes 2 days. We handle all inspections and grid connections paperwork."
